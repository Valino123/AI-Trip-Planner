      "content": "Oh, that noise is a deal-breaker. If Duquesne is noisy, it's out. We have to go with Le Bristol."

      "owner": "agent",
      "content": "Okay, decision made: We will focus on Le Bristol Paris because it meets your 'must-have' quiet environment requirement. I will use this as our 'base' for planning."
