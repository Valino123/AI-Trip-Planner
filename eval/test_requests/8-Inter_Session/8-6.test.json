      "owner": "user",

      "owner": "agent",

      "owner": "user",
      "content": "Okay, let's add the Tower. Now, I need a hotel. It must be family-friendly and have a swimming pool. The kids are non-negotiable on the pool."

      "owner": "agent",
      "content": "Understood. A hotel with a swimming pool is a 'must-have' requirement. I will filter all accommodation options based on this."

      "content": "Checking on those... yes, the Park Plaza County Hall has an indoor pool. The Melia White House does *not* have a pool, but it is close to the park and zoo."

      "owner": "user",
      "content": "Oh, well that's an easy choice then. If the Melia has no pool, it's out. We have to go with the Park Plaza."

    {
      "owner": "agent",
      "content": "Okay, decision made: We will focus on the Park Plaza County Hall because it meets your 'must-have' pool requirement. I will use this as our 'base' for planning."

      "owner": "agent",
      "content": "With kids, the Tube is fast, but the double-decker buses are an activity in themselves! I'd recommend a mix. The Tube for long distances, and the front-row-top-seat of a bus for short hops."
