Can you search for information about the main coral reef system in the Florida Keys? And also check the weather and water conditions for early February to see if it's good for diving?"

The weather_lookup should provide conditions relevant for 'scuba diving' (from background_info) including temperature, visibility factors, and sea conditions. Both tools should work together to help plan the research trip, showing coordinated multi-tool usage."
