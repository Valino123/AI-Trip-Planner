      "owner": "agent",
      "content": "Hi Laura! That sounds like a dream trip. For 10 days, I’d recommend splitting your time between **Madrid** for art and history, and **Seville** for food, culture, and southern charm. Does that sound appealing?"
    },
    {
      "owner": "user",
      "content": "Yes, Madrid and Seville sound perfect. We’d love to see the Prado Museum and do a few tapas tours. Maybe a day trip to somewhere nearby too?"
    },
    {
      "owner": "agent",
      "content": "Great idea! From Madrid, **Toledo** makes a perfect day trip — it’s filled with medieval architecture and just a short train ride away. In Seville, you can slow down and enjoy flamenco, the Alcázar, and the lively food scene. I’d suggest 5 days in Madrid (including the Toledo trip) and 5 in Seville."
    },
    {
      "owner": "user",
      "content": "That sounds lovely. I do want the trip to feel relaxed — not too many travel days or early mornings."

    {
      "owner": "agent",
      "content": "Absolutely. We can make sure the itinerary includes long lunches, evening strolls, and some free time to just enjoy the local atmosphere. Spain’s late dining culture fits that perfectly."
    },
    {
      "owner": "user",
      "content": "Perfect. My partner just reminded me that he's mostly vegetarian — will that be an issue in Seville? We’ve heard a lot about jamón and meat tapas."
    },
    {
      "owner": "agent",
      "content": "Good catch — not an issue at all. Andalusian cuisine has great vegetarian options, like salmorejo, espinacas con garbanzos (spinach with chickpeas), and plenty of vegetable tapas. I can make sure all my restaurant and tour recommendations are vegetarian-friendly."
    },
    {
      "owner": "user",
      "content": "Perfect. Okay, so Madrid with a day trip to Toledo and Seville for the second half sounds like a good balance."
    },
    {
      "owner": "agent",
      "content": "Exactly — it keeps things simple, historical, and food-focused. You’ll get art and architecture in Madrid, then Seville’s warmth and rhythm for contrast."
    },
    {
      "owner": "user",
      "content": "Actually, my partner just saw pictures of San Sebastián — the beach and the food scene look incredible. Could we swap Seville for San Sebastián? How would that change our trip, keeping our same preferences?"

The agent should compare Seville vs. San Sebastián in these terms — contrasting Seville’s historical depth and southern charm with San Sebastián’s seaside atmosphere and Basque culinary focus — while also addressing travel logistics and maintaining the trip’s calm rhythm."
